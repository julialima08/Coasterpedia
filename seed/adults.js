        "BATMAN The Ride will show you what it feels like to be BATMAN, on this deeply intense juggernaut that is definitely not for the timid. Show your strength and bravery as you take on GOTHAM's criminal element. Once you've gotten your fill touring the shady, decaying backstreets of GOTHAM CITY, load up in the batcave for a dark and riveting adventure. You're about to fight crime with your feet just dangling free in the air through 2,700ft./822.96m of track.",

Hike in through the stony ruins of an ancient civilization - a time when great mythical beasts like the Goliath were feared. You may not find it so mythical as you're getting dragged up that impossibly tall first hill, lifting you higher and higher. About halfway up this ridiculous height, even the toughest riders realize there's no way out except to battle the beast. When you crest the top of that first hill, wave to the legendary Twisted Colossus â€“ way down below you",
